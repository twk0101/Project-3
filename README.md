# Project-3
Final Project for ST 558 Summer 2022

The app that I built for this project involves using batted ball data from the MLB to predict a hitter's overall performance in a season. I touch briefly on some of the concepts behind the various stats used in the app and what they can be used to do from a predictive standpoint.

Packages required for the app:
`shinydashboard`, `shinythemes`, `mathjaxr`, `caret`, `DT`, `tidyverse`

Code for installing packages:

`install.packages("shinydashboard","shinythemes","mathjaxr","caret","DT","tidyverse")`

Code for running the app via GitHub (note that I've had to run this command twice in order to get the datatable to render on the final tab, not sure if that's a feature or a bug, but if it doesn't show up on the first try for you, I'd greatly appreciate you trying it again!)

`shiny::runGitHub("Project-3", "twk0101", subdir = "/King_Project_3/")`
